Apache Tuscany SDO Java Sample Programs

Documentation for these samples may be found in the docs/javadoc/sdo-samples directory
of this distribution.

The runsamples.sh and runsamples.bat scripts in their unedited form
provide a way to run all of the samples sequentially.  If you run these scripts
from within the directory they are found in, they will run correctly.
If you run them from elsewhere you will need to edit the scripts and set the
BINARY_BASE variable to the path in your filesystem where you unpacked the
SDO distribution.
